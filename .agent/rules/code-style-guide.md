Always use korean.

When managing states, unless they are strictly limited to two states (true/false), we avoid managing them as boolean states to ensure code extensibility.

Do not use abbreviations when writing variable names.

When writing functions, use pure functions whenever possible.

Do not add comments except for essential ones.
